  long_description: Found near the Whispering Wood, a weathered slab lies etched with cryptic lore. It speaks of Klavis, the Banished Keymaster. Once a celestial gatekeeper, he tasted forbidden bubble tea, a concoction rumored to grant wishes beyond the Cloud's control. Now condemned, Klavis dwells within the wild, his power twisted. Legends whisper of "Charming Slack," a fantastical bridge born from his exile, serving a new purpose - a wish granted, a gateway for aspiring programmers, forever veiled in the sweet, whimsical magic of the Wood.
